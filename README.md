The goal of this study was to investigate the socioeconomic determinants and personality effects of psychological well-being in Australia using The Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) year 2017 datasets. This paper investigated a relationship between psychological wellness and other external aspects of our lives which are social and economic related, as well as internal factors, personality traits and temperament. It aims to determine if happiness is defined more by people’s situations and life events or personality traits (Big Five), or the balance between the two factors. Ordinal logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify factors that have impacts on the target variable, psychological well-being. The analysis found that personality traits have a slightly stronger influence in individuals’ psychological well- being than external factors, in which this case, income, marital status and some aspects of the labour force area have shown significance. Income has a small positive effect on psychological well-being whereas relationships as observed in marital status suggest that people who are married or are in a De Facto relationship are happier than those who are separated or single. Job demands, complexity and effort-reward fairness appear to be a more important factor to happiness than job control.


The HILDA dataset was accessed and obtained from the study of Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research on The Household, Income and Labour Dynamic in Australia (HILDA) by signing a Confidentiality deed with The National Centre for Longitudinal Data (NCLD) who is responsible for the management of the study. The dataset was in SPSS files consisting of 17 waves from the year 2001 - 2017. The scope of this study is on wave 17 which is the year 2017 in which the original data has 5,588 variables across different subject areas and 23,415 observations.
